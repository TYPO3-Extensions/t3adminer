2011-06-09 Jigal van Hemert  <jigal@xs4all.nl>

	* made styling of table list similar to pagetree (active item only working in IE / Safari because Firefox / Chrome use Ajax
	  call to only load content block)
	* changed styling of links on top to tabs similar to TYPO3 backend (the content below can't be in a block because of the
	  HTML generated by Adminer)
	* various small CSS issues fixed (tested in Firefox 4, IE9, Safari and Chrome)
